    <h1>HEALTHY LIFESTYLE</h1>
    <h2>Health Definition</h2>
    <p>Health has a variety of definitions, which have been used for different purposes over time.
        In general, it refers to physical and emotional well-being, especially that associated with 
        normal functioning of the human body, absent of disease, pain (including mental pain), or injury.</p>

    <p>Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical exercise and 
        adequate sleep, and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress. 
        Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior,
        while others are due to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder 
        for people to get necessary healthcare services. Still, other factors are beyond both individual and group choices, such as genetic disorders.</p>

    <h3>Health categories:</h3>

        <li>Nutrition</li>
        <li>Exercise</li>
        <li>Sleep</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Nutrition</h3>
    <p>Proper nutrition is the foundation of good health. Eating a balanced diet that includes
         a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats ensures your 
         body gets the essential nutrients it needs. Aim to limit processed foods, added sugars, and 
         excessive salt. Staying hydrated is equally important—drink plenty of water throughout the day 
         for optimal energy and metabolism.</p>

    <h3>Exercise</h3>
    <p>Regular physical activity boosts both physical and mental well-being. Whether it’s walking, running,
         strength training, or yoga, find activities you enjoy and aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate
         exercise per week. Movement improves cardiovascular health, strengthens muscles and bones, and 
         reduces stress, making it a cornerstone of a healthy lifestyle.</p>

    <h3>Sleep</h3>
    <p>Quality sleep is essential for the body’s recovery and overall functioning. Adults should strive for
         7-9 hours of sleep per night, while children and teens need even more. Create a calming bedtime routine,
         limit screen time before bed, and keep a consistent sleep schedule to improve sleep quality. A well-rested
         body and mind enhance focus, immunity, and emotional resilience.</p>

    <h2>Healthy habits</h2>
    <h3>Daily Hydration</h3>
    <p>Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated and support your body’s functions, 
        such as digestion and circulation. Keep a reusable water bottle handy to remind yourself 
        to sip regularly. Limiting sugary drinks is a simple way to improve your health.</p>

    <h3>Mindful Relaxation</h3>
    <p>Take time to unwind each day with stress-reducing activities like yoga, journaling, or 
        deep breathing. Practicing mindfulness helps you stay present and improves mental clarity. 
        Even a 10-minute break can reenergize your mind and reduce daily pressures.</p>

    <h3>Building Connections</h3>
    <p>Spending time with friends and family fosters emotional well-being and creates a strong support
         system. Sharing laughter, conversations, or activities can improve mood and combat feelings of
          loneliness. Healthy relationships play a vital role in overall happiness.</p>
